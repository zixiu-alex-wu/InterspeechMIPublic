# Towards Automated Counselling Decision-Making: Remarks on Therapist Action Forecasting on the AnnoMI Dataset
* Code for our INTERSPEECH 2022 submission titled "Towards Automated Counselling Decision-Making: Remarks on Therapist Action Forecasting on the AnnoMI Dataset"
* Our code is ready and will be hosted in this repository: https://github.com/philips-internal/InterspeechMIPublic, which currently you are most likely not able to access because there is an ongoing internal procedure at our company that needs to complete before the open-sourcing of our code is authorised. We expect to be granted permission very soon, and then you will be able to access the code.
